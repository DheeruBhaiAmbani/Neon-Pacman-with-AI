- **60 FPS Smooth Animation**: Fluid gameplay experience
- **Screen Wrapping**: Seamless movement across screen boundaries

### 🤖 AI-Powered Ghosts (4 Unique Types)
- **🔴 Red Ghost (Aggressive)**: 
  - Direct pathfinding chase toward Pacman
  - Uses shortest path algorithm
  - Most dangerous and persistent

- **🩷 Pink Ghost (Ambush)**:
  - Predicts Pacman's movement direction
  - Targets 4 cells ahead of Pacman
  - Strategic positioning for ambush attacks

- **🔵 Blue Ghost (Patrol)**:
  - Guards strategic corner positions
  - Follows predefined patrol routes
  - Defensive behavior pattern

- **🟣 Purple Ghost (Random)**:
  - Unpredictable movement patterns
  - Random target selection
  - Adds chaos to gameplay

### 🔊 Retro Chiptune Audio
- **Programmatic Sound Generation**: Created using NumPy waveforms
- **Sound Effects**:
  - Pellet collection (short beep)
  - Power pellet collection (ascending tone)
  - Ghost collision (descending tone)
  - Game over (dramatic sequence)
- **Graceful Fallback**: Works in environments without audio

### 🎯 Game Mechanics
- **Classic Gameplay**: Collect pellets, avoid ghosts, score points
- **Scoring System**: 10 points per pellet, 50 per power pellet
- **Lives System**: 3 lives with position reset on collision
- **Win/Lose Conditions**: Clear all pellets to win, lose all lives to lose
- **Pause Functionality**: SPACE to pause/unpause
- **Collision Detection**: Precise detection for walls, pellets, and ghosts

### 🏗️ Technical Implementation
- **Intelligent Pathfinding**: Ghosts navigate around walls using distance-based algorithms
- **Real-time AI**: Ghost behavior adapts to player movement every frame
- **Maze Generation**: Procedural maze with walls, pellets, and power pellets
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Clean separation of concerns (Game, Pacman, Ghost, Maze, Audio)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of audio and display issues

### 🛠️ Development Tools
- **Setup Script**: Automated environment setup with `setup.py`
- **Launcher Script**: One-click game launch with `run_game.sh`
- **Test Suite**: AI behavior testing with `test_ai.py`
- **Demo Script**: AI behavior demonstration with `demo_ai.py`
- **Virtual Environment**: Isolated Python environment for dependencies

## 🎮 Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move Pacman (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- **SPACE**: Pause/Unpause game
- **ESC**: Quit game

## 📊 Game Statistics

- **Frame Rate**: 60 FPS
- **Ghost Count**: 4 AI-powered ghosts
- **Pellet Count**: ~660 regular pellets + 5 power pellets
- **Wall Count**: ~200 maze walls

## 🚀 Performance Features
- **Optimized Rendering**: Efficient drawing with glow effects
- **Smart AI Updates**: Ghosts only recalculate paths when needed
- **Memory Efficient**: Minimal object creation during gameplay
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows

## 🧪 Testing & Quality
- **✅ All AI behaviors tested and verified**
- **✅ Audio system with fallback handling**
- **✅ Maze generation validated**
- **✅ Game mechanics thoroughly tested**
- **✅ Setup and installation scripts verified**

## 🎯 AI Behavior Verification
The demo script shows each ghost type exhibiting distinct behaviors:
- Red Ghost consistently moves toward Pacman's current position
- Pink Ghost targets ahead of Pacman's movement direction
- Blue Ghost follows patrol patterns to strategic positions
- Purple Ghost displays unpredictable movement patterns

This implementation delivers a complete, modern take on the classic Pacman game with sophisticated AI opponents and stunning neon visuals!
